## Intellij Sublime Text Keymap

1. Add the plugins to the **User** plugins directory. 
On macOS, it's located at: `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text/Packages/User`.
You can find the path to Sublime Text plugins using the Sublime Console (Cmd + \`) and executing `sublime.packages_path()`. 

2. Update your key bindings.
3. (Optional) Add extra Intellij-flavoured settings.
